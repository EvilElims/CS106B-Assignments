Perfect Numbers
---------------

Before submitting this file, make sure that there are no more TODO
placeholders remaining in the file (and remove this comment too).

Q1. Roughly how long did it take your computer to do the search? How many perfect numbers were found and what were they?
A1. 2.6 sec; Four perfect numbers were found:6,28,496,8128

Q2. Record the timing results for `findPerfects` that you observed into a table.
A2. n           runtime
    30000       1.361 secs
    60000       4.543 secs
    120000      15.783 secs
    240000      61.741 secs

Q3. Does it take the same amount of work to compute `isPerfect` on the number 10 as it does on the number 1000? Why or why not? Does it take the same amount of work for `findPerfects` to search the range of numbers from 1-1000 as it does to search the numbers from 1000-2000? Why or why not?
A3. 1.No.'isPerfect' need call fuction 'divisorSum' and work of compute 'divisorSum' is relate to parameter 'n';
    2.No.Each iteration of 'findPerfects' call fuction 'isPerfect'.

Q4. Extrapolate from the data you gathered and make a prediction: how long will it take `findPerfects` to reach the fifth perfect number?
A4. (33000000/240000)**2*1 min ≈ 18900 min

Q5. Do any of the tests still pass even with this broken function? Why or why not?
A5. NO.

Q6. Describe the testing strategy you used for your test cases to confirm `smarterSum` is working correctly.
A6. STUDENT_TEST("confirm smarterSum is working correctly"){
        EXPECT_EQUAL(smarterSum(25),divisorSum(25));//ege test
        EXPECT_EQUAL(smarterSum(1),divisorSum(1));//ege test
        EXPECT_EQUAL(smarterSum(10000),divisorSum(10000));
    }

Q7. Record your timing results for `findPerfectsSmarter` into a table.
A7.     n           runtime
        625000      3.622 secs
        1250000     8.951 secs
        2500000     24.133 secs
        5000000     63.825 secs

Q8. Make a prediction: how long will `findPerfectsSmarter` take to reach the fifth perfect number?
A8. 17 min

Q9. Explain how you chose your specific test cases and why they lead you to be confident `findNthPerfectEuclid` is working correctly.
A9. STUDENT_TEST("confirm findNthPerfectEuclid is working correctly"){
        EXPECT_EQUAL(findNthPerfectEuclid(1),6);
        EXPECT_EQUAL(findNthPerfectEuclid(2),28);
        EXPECT_EQUAL(findNthPerfectEuclid(3),496);
        EXPECT_EQUAL(findNthPerfectEuclid(4),8128);
    }

Soundex
-------

Q10. What is the Soundex code for "Angelou"? What is the code for your own ?
A10. "Angelou"(A524);"Wu"(W000);

Q11. Before writing any code, brainstorm your plan of attack and sketch how you might decompose the work into smaller tasks. Briefly describe your decomposition strategy.
A11. TODO

Q12. Think about one or more examples of a class of names that the Soundex system might not work well for. Explain what this class of names is and why the system might incorrectly group them or mis-categorize one of the names.
A12. TODO

Q13. Suppose you are a software engineer working for the U.S. government. You have been tasked with implementing a system that collects names as part of the Census survey and analyzes these names using a phonetic algorithm. Your boss suggests using Soundex and notes that the algorithm is only expected to work for ASCII-encoded strings, since supporting Unicode would require extra work and time. What would your response be and why? What representational harms might result from building a system that exclusively uses Soundex and/or ASCII?
A13. TODO
